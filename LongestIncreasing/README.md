# Longest Increasing Subsequence.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project Objective:

As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

 

## Background of the problem statement:

As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.

 

You must use the following:

  * Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application.
  * Java: A programming language.
  * Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub.
  * GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions. 
  * Core Java concepts: variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.
 

Following requirements should be met:

  * The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories.
  * The code should work properly for n numbers, where n<100.
