# Fix Bugs of the Application.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective:

As a developer, fix the bugs in the application using the appropriate algorithmic techniques.

 

## Background of the problem statement:

You have been assigned a few tasks during the sprint planning. Solving the bugs raised by the testing team is one among them. You are given the boilerplate code and are asked to complete it by fixing the bugs.

 

## Bugs to be fixed:

 * Add the missing source code to the application based on searching technique. Find the appropriate comments to code for the searching technique.
    - Implement a search algorithm with O(n) or better complexity.
    - It is acceptable to sort first in order to facilitate a binary search if desired.
* Write source code for sorting the predefined array and ensure the functionality of the application. Find the appropriate comments to code for sorting the predefined array.
    - The sort should be your own code not calling `ArrayList.sort()`
    - Please try to implement an O(n log n) sorting algorithm.
    - If you had already turned this in prior with bubble sort that is ok.
* You can download the boilerplate code by executing the command below in your git bash.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Full-Stack---The-Desk-Application-.git
```
 

## You must use the following:

 * Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application
 * Java: A programming language to develop the prototype
 * Git: To connect and push files from local system to GitHub
 * GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 
 * Search and Sort techniques: Select the relevant data structure algorithms to fix the bugs
 

## Following requirements should be met:

 * The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repositories. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in the Google Docs.
 * The link of your GitHub repository is must. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in the Google Docs.
 * Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task.
